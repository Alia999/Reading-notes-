A text editor is a piece of software that we download and install on our computers ,or we use through the web browser.
The features that should be taken into consideration when we choose a text editor are the following:
1- code completion 
2- syntax highlighting 
3- a nice variety of themes 
We can use the editor which we already have on our computers like the NotePad.
The command line/terminal 
A text based interface to the system 
A command line can be open-up in a number of windows with different tasks for each one. 
Basic navigation 
Pwd-> print working directory 
Ls-> list documents 
Paths 
Tilde-> to refer to the directory/with the path
Dot-> your current directory
dotdot->the parent directory + the root directory 
Cd->change directories 

Files 
Everything is a file even if its a text or a photo. 
We can use spaces with names but we should use quotes.
Escape characters 
We should use / to separate characters 
Hidden files and directories start with a full stop.
