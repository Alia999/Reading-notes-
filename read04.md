SLIDESHOWS

Slideshows can display a number of different images
(or other HTML content) within the same space
on a given page. They can play automatically as
a sequence, or users can click through the slides
manually. They allow more content to be displayed
within a limited amount of space.

FORMS
Validating forms (checking whether they have been
filled in correctly) is important when information is
supplied by users. JavaScript lets you alert the user
if mistakes have been made. It can also perform
sophisticated calculations based on any data entered
and reveal the results to the user.

A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
