# HTML
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.

With HTML you can create your own Website.


You met the < body > element 
in the first example we created. 
Everything inside this element is 
shown inside the main browser 
window.
< head >
Before the < body > element you 
will often see a < head > element. 
This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 
You will usually find a < title>
element inside the < head>
element.

< title>
The contents of the < title>
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page (if your 
browser uses tabs to allow you 
to view multiple pages at the 
same time).
< h1>
< h2>
< h3>
< h4>
< h5>
 < h6>
HTML has six "levels" of 
headings:
Structural markup: the elements that you can use to 
describe both headings and paragraphs

< b>
By enclosing words in the tags 
< b> and </ b> we can make 
characters appear bold.

< i>
By enclosing words in the tags 
< i> and </ i> we can make 
characters appear italic.

< sup>
The < sup> element is used 
to contain characters that 
should be superscript such 
as the suffixes of dates or 
mathematical concepts like 
raising a number to a power such 
as 22
.
< sub>
The < sub> element is used to 
contain characters that should 
be subscript. It is commonly 
used with foot notes or chemical 
formulas such as H2
0.

< br />
As you have already seen, the 
browser will automatically show 
each new paragraph or heading 
on a new line. But if you wanted 
to add a line break inside the 
middle of a paragraph you can 
use the line break tag < br />.

< em>
The < em> element indicates 
emphasis that subtly changes 
the meaning of a sentence.
By default browsers will show 
the contents of an < em> element 
in italic.

< q>
The < q> element is used for 
shorter quotes that sit within 
a paragraph. Browsers are 
supposed to put quotes around 
the < q> element, however 
Internet Explorer does not â€” 
therefore many people avoid 
using the < q> element.


< input>
type="checkbox"
Checkboxes allow users to select 
(and unselect) one or more 
options in answer to a question.
name
The name attribute is sent to 
the server with the value of the 
option(s) the user selects. When 
a question provides users with 
options for answers in the form 
of checkboxes, the value of the 
name attribute should be the 
same for all of the buttons that 
answer that question.
value
The value attribute indicates 
the value sent to the server if this 
checkbox is checked.

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for 
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating 
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS 
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
