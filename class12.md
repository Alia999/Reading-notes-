EASILY CREATE STUNNING ANIMATED CHARTS WITH CHART.JS
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.
Setting up
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>

Drawing a line chart
To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page:
<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element:

<script>
    var buyers = document.getElementById('buyers').getContext('2d');
    new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);
</script>
Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart. Add this immediately above the line that begins ‘var buyers=’:
var buyerData = {
	labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
	datasets : [
		{
			fillColor : "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",
			strokeColor : "#ACC26D",
			pointColor : "#fff",
			pointStrokeColor : "#9DB86D",
			data : [203,156,99,251,305,247]
		}
	]
}


Basic usage of canvas

The <canvas> element

<canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>

At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

Drawing shapes with canvas
« Previous

Now that we have set up our canvas environment, we can get into the details of how to draw on the canvas. By the end of this article, you will have learned how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is essential when drawing objects onto the canvas and we will see how that can be done.

The grid
Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. To the right, you see this canvas with the default grid overlayed. Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.

Drawing rectangles
Unlike SVG, <canvas> only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.

First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

fillRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a filled rectangle.
strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectangular outline.
clearRect(x, y, width, height)
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle. width and height provide the rectangle's size


Applying styles and colors

In the chapter about drawing shapes, we used only the default line and fill styles. Here we will explore the canvas options we have at our disposal to make our drawings a little more attractive. You will learn how to add different colors, line styles, gradients, patterns and shadows to your drawings.


Colors
Up until now we have only seen methods of the drawing context. If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

fillStyle = color
Sets the style used when filling shapes.
strokeStyle = color
Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).

A fillStyle example
In this example, we once again use two for loops to draw a grid of rectangles, each in a different color. The resulting image should look something like the screenshot. There is nothing too spectacular happening here. We use the two variables i and j to generate a unique RGB color for each square, and only modify the red and green values. The blue channel has a fixed value. By modifying the channels, you can generate all kinds of palettes. By increasing the steps, you can achieve something that looks like the color palettes Photoshop uses.


Drawing text
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
A fillText example
The text is filled using the current fillStyle.

function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = '48px serif';
  ctx.fillText('Hello world', 10, 50);
}


A strokeText example
The text is filled using the current strokeStyle.

function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = '48px serif';
  ctx.strokeText('Hello world', 10, 50);
}


Styling text
In the examples above we are already making use of the font property to make the text a bit larger than the default size. There are some more properties which let you adjust the way the text gets displayed on the canvas:

font = value
The current text style being used when drawing text. This string uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. The default font is 10px sans-serif.
textAlign = value
Text alignment setting. Possible values: start, end, left, right or center. The default value is start.
textBaseline = value
Baseline alignment setting. Possible values: top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, bottom. The default value is alphabetic.
direction = value
Directionality. Possible values: ltr, rtl, inherit. The default value is inherit.
These properties might be familiar to you, if you have worked with CSS before.

The following diagram from the WHATWG demonstrates the various baselines supported by the textBaseline property.The top of the em square is
roughly at the top of the glyphs in a font, the hanging baseline is
where some glyphs like आ are anchored, the middle is half-way
between the top of the em square and the bottom of the em square,
the alphabetic baseline is where characters like Á, ÿ,
f, and Ω are anchored, the ideographic baseline is
where glyphs like 私 and 達 are anchored, and the bottom
of the em square is roughly at the bottom of the glyphs in a
font. The top and bottom of the bounding box can be far from these
baselines, due to glyphs extending far outside the em square.

A textBaseline example
Edit the code below and see your changes update live in the canvas:

ctx.font = '48px serif';
ctx.textBaseline = 'hanging';
ctx.strokeText('Hello world', 0, 100);


Advanced text measurements
In the case you need to obtain more details about the text, the following method allows you to measure it.

measureText()
Returns a TextMetrics object containing the width, in pixels, that the specified text will be when drawn in the current text style.
The following code snippet shows how you can measure a text and get its width.

function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  var text = ctx.measureText('foo'); // TextMetrics object
  text.width; // 16;
}
Gecko-specific notes
In Gecko (the rendering engine of Firefox, Firefox OS and other Mozilla based applications), some prefixed APIs were implemented in earlier versions to draw text on a canvas. These are now deprecated and removed, and are no longer guaranteed to work.
